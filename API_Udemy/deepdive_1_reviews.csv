80243510,Excellent course. Excellent delivery!
80027284,A great match for me. Exactly what I was searching for. This in depth look into python was just what I wanted
80004092,"I was looking for a class that would not waste time with telling me what a loop is. This class is a must take.
The only negative is that there is a lot of repetition. I believe it could have been done in half the time by eliminating a lot of the repetition and, in some cases typing. Still, I highly recommend it."
79970808,"It's still early on in the course, but I am really enjoying Fred's style. I think this rating will go up to 5, but I won't be able to increase it after that so 4.5 it is for now."
79921688,One of the excellent courses that I have attended so far.
79775868,"After 2+ years of using python at work I thought I had a good understanding of it. Oh boy was I wrong. This course really helped in understanding the misterious magic of python (like closures, decorators and the import logic). The instructor is gifted with a very clear and expressiv kind of teaching, I find it almost art. The topics are really good structured an explained."
79739270,This is the best curse what see
79733536,The best in-depth course!
79711656,"Simply the best course out there on ""core Python"" (i.e., the standard library and the language itself). Fred rocks!!!"
79695440,"Have not yet finished the course, but I feel that this course is very detail and the instructor make python's problems clear. I have bought all 4 parts of this course"
79643260,Great level of detail and knowledge.
79174774,"Well, I do have basic understanding of the Python semantics. However this course helped me to get insights of them. Most recommended course for Python enthusiasts"
79170624,"A course which truly deserves its ""Deep Dive"" title."
79036344,Very knowledgeable instructor & top notch material!
79005120,Excellent information and mode of teaching! Outstanding! Thank you !
79001872,Great Video
78765570,"there are few courses for intermediate learners out there, this one is ideal for diving deeper, as the title suggests. 
-1/2 star because the videos and the annotation function sometimes don't load properly."
78751744,"Mr Baptiste is highly knowledgeable, presents information clearly and concisely, and intuitively builds understanding from the ground up."
78603020,"That course is just so incredible. Fred  does give you an under the hood  knowledge of python.
Best investment I ever made"
78033858,"Very good course, well described advanced parts of python."
77762764,The instructor has a really in-depth knowledge of the language. It's totally worth to buy.
77649000,"I have a lot of experience in other programming languages, but new to python. That's probably the ideal target group for this course. Sometimes it's a bit slow, but playing the video at a higher speed fixes that."
77392786,"He's very knowledgeable, articulate, and organized. He gives a thorough explanation of things."
77365682,Great follow on course when u are past the basics. I have been looking for courses that go past the basics and this one builds on your knowledge and takes you further down the road. Should not be your first course but if u tired of the same beginner stuff then this one is for you
77359354,It looks to be good starting point to understand python in detail
77311040,"Very in depth understanding of Python, He is Python enthusiast and it shows in his delivery, I have taken so many courses from Udemy but this one is very exceptional. Thank You very much Mr. Fred you are a real gem !! Keep sharing your Python knowledge by developing more courses."
77060368,the lectures are very well organized and are very informative!
76865598,"This course was beyond my expectations, since for me it is relevant to know how things work and why, not only: this is the way of doing it-course-approach.   So, thank you Fred for making it truly clear and understandable."
76720046,"Most knowledgeable instructor in any course I've taken.  Great examples, very thorough.  Unlikely that there is any better course on Python at this depth.  Unqualified recommendation."

76295114,Excellent courses and lecturing style!
76281530,"Marvelous course! Finally, explanations for the things I find in code but have had a difficult time understanding how to use effectively. The sections on decorators and function parameters were worth the whole course. Thank you, Fred.

Most definitely not for a beginner Python programmer."
76272360,"Yes, This is the best Python course on Udemy platform."
76240814,"Yes. I am an advanced user of Python, love the language and enjoy learning about the nitty griddy of the language."

75960184,"Very in-depth class. Not for a beginner, but will help those with base python knowledge to grow significantly."
75609292,The most systematic and deep explanations of all possible python topics I have ever encountered. Didactically perfect.
75553408,"Great course, very indepth and clear instruction, I have taken over 150 courses on here over the past 10 years and this is in the top 5. Highly recommended!"
75306542,This is exactly what I was looking for; someone showing the language under the hood. This really helps understanding and therefore applying it much better going forward
75174484,"Great course - I highly recommend it. My only reservation is that there aren't exercises or projects to do, but there are in Parts 2-4.
Straight to Part 2 for me!"
75137412,Amazing Classes. He is a Genius!
75108834,yes
74997218,great

74272492,Great course.
74160290,"The course is called Deep Dive and it is really a deep dive into python programming. It is a great learning experience with Fred, if you really want to be an expert in python then you must take the Deep Dive series created by Fred."
73857380,Amazing course. All the content was explained in detail. Fred is an excellent instructor.
73807840,too long
73802942,"Instrutor tem ótima didática e o curso explica a linguagem nos mínimos detalhes, como o próprio nome sugere"
73788230,I wanted to get deeper understanding of Python and also be able to answer python technical interview questions.
73771238,Good match for my current beginner level in python
73679448,"I am so pleased wit this course. The content is superb and Fred's delivery is fantastic. I've only done about 15% of the course so far, but have already learned things about Python I never knew existed before. I went ahead and bought the other three courses as well and have zero regrets. This course has made me love Python even more than I did before and I can finally start calling myself more than an intermediate-level Python user."
73612170,Very impressed with outline and depth of language coverage
73468834,Clear and precise
73441462,"Yes, I would have liked to come across some hands-on question intermediately between the chapters which could help to get better hold on the topics"
73317310,"Other Python courses, even though they were pretty good, taught me how to use Python. This course was the first time I felt I learnt about Python itself. How it works and why it works the way it does. It seems to live in a different dimension. Amazing..."
73316624,great and detailed explanation of topics
73188048,"I thought this was one of the best online courses I've taken. Fred, the instructor, starts with basic elements of the Python language and then builds upon them. I very much liked the lecture then coding structure he use throughout the course. It gives the student the opportunity to first conceptualize and then apply what he/she has just learnt. Also, the downloadable course material is excellent.

I do think the prerequisite description of this course is correct. It's not a course for someone who has no knowledge of Python. However if you're a recent data science boot camp grad it's a great follow-on as it really explains the ""why"" of the Python tools which you just studied."
73116316,"Fred is one of the best teachers I have ever learned from. If you are interested in thoroughly learning the Python language and are willing to invest your time to learn it, this series will benefit you greatly. Fred does not simply cover information. He teaches the reasons why Python behaves the way it does and imparts understanding. Knowing WHY a certain behavior happens in a program teaches at a deeper level. Hence the name of the series. I would love to learn other languages from this instructor. Great quality!"
73104542,Amazing course!
72883338,"Very detailed lessons on each data type, completely changes the way you used to code because you understand the components better."
72846452,"if you want to learn Python properly, invest on all 4 parts, i spent lots of money and time on other python courses in udemy. they were nothing compare to just this first course from Fred.
he is a best Tutor and he spent lots of his time providing materials.
Thank you very much Fred."
72833622,This course will be great for deepening my understanding of Python.
72717624,I enjoyed very much learning many new concepts which is essential in python. He provides many examples which helps you to understand better. I wish I could rate it more than 5-star
72703398,This course is very clear and easy to learn.
72682806,"The instructor teaches well. It is as if I am reading a text book, except it is not reading a book, I am seeing the examples play out on the screen along with all the exceptions and typos, yes even the typos that we make routinely in our code. Great to understand what happens when you do this or when you do that. I wanted exactly this style of teaching. Fantastic course !!"
72659096,Even the refresher part on Python was very useful. Liking it so far!
72620710,By far the best python tutorial on the internet. I purchased all 4 courses he has and can't wait to finish them all in the coming weeks. Knowing what's going on under the hood is essential in building a foundation to being a really proficient python dev.
72512452,"I think this is the best class on a specific language I have seen.

The instructor Fred not only goes through the details, but explicitly shows the logic behind each feature. It is also very very thorough."
72408424,I like the instructor's voice and way of articulating his ideas.
72327890,"super comprehensible, guided and practical course! Thanks Fred!!!"
72258476,.
72157604,Awesome course. I really enjoyed it! Thank you
71972168,Looks good.  Seems to be what I need to level up my python skills.
71950586,"Excellent course, very well taught. The teacher is very knowledgeable and master its subject. Its teaching is very thorough and yet easy to follow."
71904504,"Most of it done at double speed with squeaky voice which just about is ok, but haven't the time to do it slower!"
