# Fun Python Projects

Recently, I've been having quite a lot of free-time, so I decided to do something useful with my programing knowledge.
I spent time trying to figure out what task costed me energy most that could be coded to run automatically.
Lots of ideas started to pop up in my head. Some of which were as crazy as it may sound. I did think of ways to bring down
a website that I don't like =). Obviously it was an unsuccessful attempt. Besides messing things around, I created a 
python script that would send me information about tutoring classes. I put a filter on that so I can get what
classes fit me the most. It was fun to see how coding helps facilitate my daily life!!
