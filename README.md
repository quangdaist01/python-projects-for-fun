# Introduction

Recently, I've been having quite a lot of free time, so I decided to do something useful with my programming knowledge.
I spent time trying to figure out what task cost me the most energy that could be coded to run automatically.
Lots of ideas started to pop up in my head.
The very first thing I did is writing a script that would send me information about tutoring classes. I put a filter on that so I can get what
classes fit me the most. It was fun to see how coding helps facilitate my daily life!!
